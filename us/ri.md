# United States - Rhode Island

Rhode Island recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.

Rhode Island is not a "sanctuary state", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Rhode Island non-discrimination laws.
 * Rhode Island does have a religious freedom law that may provide
   religious exemptions to non-discrimination law in some limited
   circumstances.

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Air Travel

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
