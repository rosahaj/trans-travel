# United States - New Hampshire

New Hampshire does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  However, if HB396 is
signed, this may significantly impact trans travelers by removing
protections for trans people and requiring discrimination against trans
people in several cases, including bathrooms.

New Hampshire, if HB619 is signed by the governor, would criminalize some
surgical trans care for children, but does not generally criminalize other
gender-related care, thus it appears that parents visiting with trans
children will not risk custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * New Hampshire non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.
   If HB396 is signed, however, that would change, and trans people
   would be explicitly excluded for some protections, including bathroom
   access.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
   However, if HB396 is signed, these protections would be eliminated
   and certain facilities would be restricted on the basis of
   transphobic definitions of sex.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * New Hampshire does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men. However, if HB396 is
   signed, this would always be the case.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women. However, if HB396 is
   signed, this would always be the case.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth. However, if HB396 is signed, this would always be
   the case.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in New Hampshire, such as
state IDs, but not birth certificates.

However, if HB396 is signed, transphobic definitions of sex would apply
in some cases.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * However, HB619, if signed by the governor (it is unsigned as of
   May 17, 2024), would include a ban on genital surgery for youth.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse.
   However, HB619, if signed by the governor (it is unsigned as of
   May 17, 2024), would include a ban on genital surgery for youth. This
   is unlikely to affect most families with trans children.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Visitors should be cautious as HB619 may impact trans and
gender non-conforming cis people if it is signed by the governor. It is
unknown if the governor will sign it (as of May 29, 2024), but the
governor has indicated he is concerned about "fairness" and "safety,"
which are frequently political code-words for transphobia.

Littleton, NH, considered a ban on all public art displays because some art
was created to [express inclusion
themes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-hampshire-town-art-debate-1.7014430).
This town also decided to not renew a lease for a local theater company which
performed a play that included LGBT characters.  However, the official
responsible for the attempt at banning art [did not run for
re-election](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=630&inflect=2).

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
