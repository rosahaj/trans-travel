# USA - New Hampshire

New Hampshire does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.

New Hampshire does not appear to place child custody at risk.

However, HB619-FN, if passed, would ban surgical transition for youth
and go beyond most other bans of care by both claiming to ban conversion
therapy while explictly allowing a specific form of conversion therapy.


## Non-discrimination Law

 * New Hampshire non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * New Hampshire does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in New Hampshire, such as
state IDs, but not birth certificates.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * However, HB619-FN, as of Oct. 31, 2023, is being debated which could
   include ban on surgical care for youth. This law would also enshrine
   a fake conversion therapy ban, that explicitly allows "exploratory"
   therapy, a form of conversion therapy.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Littleton, NH, is, as of November 3, 2023, is considering a ban on all
public art displays because some art was created to [express inclusion
themes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-hampshire-town-art-debate-1.7014430).
This town has also decided to not renew a lease for a local theater
company which performed a play that included LGBT characters.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
