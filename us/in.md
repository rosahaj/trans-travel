# USA - Indiana

Indiana negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

Indiana does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.
This law, however, is temporarily stayed pending resolution of K.C. v.
Medical Licensing Board, meaning that it is currently unenforceable by
the state and care remains legal for youth (with the exception of gender
reassignment surgery). (last update: June 16, 2023)

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Indiana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
   Indianapolis-Marion County.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Indiana.
 * Indiana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Indiana does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Indiana law bans transition-related surgeries for prisoners in state
   prisons.  This is being [challenged by the
   ACLU](https://www.aclu-in.org/en/press-releases/aclu-indiana-sues-idoc-over-new-law-bans-trans-medical-care-correctional-facilities).

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

State identification can be changed. Some identification may require a
court order, however, and some courts have proven resistant to changing
identification. In addition, for birth certificates, different appeals
courts have reached [different
decisions for children](https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judicial-uncertainty-continues-over-birth-certificate-changes-for-transgender-hoosiers/article_e2032d1e-ef6d-11ed-8865-7bb25f459685.html)
on changing the gender marker on birth certificates. However, the
Indiana Legal Service's LGBT Project can [provide
assistance](https://www.indianalegalservices.org/namegendermarkerfaq)
for this or other name-change issues.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
   people under 18 has passed and became law.  This law, however, is
   temporarily stayed pending resolution of K.C. v.  Medical Licensing
   Board, meaning that it is currently (June 16, 2023) unenforceable by
   the state and care remains legal for youth (with the exception of
   gender reassignment surgery).
 * Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
   (currently, as of June 24, 2023, unenforceable) law applies only to
   medical providers.
 * Hormone therapy is allowed for children who were on hormone therapy
   prior to June 30, 2023 until December 31, 2023, at which time these
   children will no longer be allowed to receive hormone therapy.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.
 * Conversion therapy is not banned and municipalities are banned from
   enacting rules banning conversion therapy.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
   for children is illegal (although this law, with the exception of the
   ban on gender reassignment surgery, is currently unenforceable due to
   a preliminary injunction as of June 16, 2023). This ban shows the
   state's view of this care.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 3 in schools.

A former student at Indiana University has accused the police department
of being [unwilling to fully
investigate](https://www.idsnews.com/article/2023/09/former-iu-student-declan-farley-posts-update-harassment-last-year)
anti-trans and anti-gay harassment.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
