# United States - Louisiana

The NAACP of Louisiana has requested the national organization [issue a
travel advisory](https://www.wbrz.com/news/naacp-seeking-travel-advisory-for-louisiana-citing-concerning-policies/)
for Louisiana, on the basis of anti-Black and anti-LGBT state bills that
could place both Black and LGBT people at risk.

Louisiana does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly.

Louisiana does ban trans care for children, although the current law does
not have criminal penalties for parents.  However, it is unknown how this
might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Louisiana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity, particularly New Orleans and Shreveport.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Louisiana.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Louisiana does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * At least one visitor (not an inmate) was told to [strip and expose her
   genitalia](https://www.nola.com/lawsuit-angola-prison-guards-ordered-transgender-visitor-to-strip/article_6cf44702-2b01-537b-94f4-c3ca7894e332.html)
   while going through security to visit a prisoner at Angola Prison because
   her anatomy did not match her gender expression.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

## Medical Care

   under 18 is illegal.

   court](https://lambdalegal.org/legal_document/soe_la_20240108_petition-for-declaratory-permanent-injunctive-relief/).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Louisiana, although penalties
   will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

New Orleans has a visible LGBT population, but this is not the case in
other parts of Louisiana, including some nearby cities of New Orleans.

"Sexually explicit" materials in libraries (electronically or in print)
are restricted. This will likely be used to target LGBT material.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
