# United Kingdom

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of UK law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to UK.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

UK also has a unique legal system, with some legal responsibilities
locally in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, while others are held
by the UK Parliament.  An attempt to point out these differences, when
relevant is made below.  In addition, the Crown Dependencies and British
Overseas Territories will be discussed in other pages -- this page
covers England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland only.

## Summary

The UK has non-discrimination law that protects "gender reassignment"
(defined as proposing to undergo, undergoing or having undergone a
process to reassign your sex) in the Equality Act.

UK does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * The 2010 Equality Act protects "gender reassignment" (including those
   who propose, are in the process of undergoing, or have undergone
   "gender reassignemnt).  Medical procedures are not necessary for a
   person to be covered under this provision.
 * The law assumes a binary "gender reassignment", and does not
   reference non-binary people.
 * While harassment and discrimination against trans people are
   generally prohibited under the law, limited exceptions exist for
   some transphobic speech in limited situations and restricting
   some single-sex activities and spaces in trans-exclusionary ways. There
   is a significant burden placed upon people doing these activities however.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people can use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. Note
   however that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
   However, a trans person can use a toilet that fits their "gender
   reassignment" associated gender.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * UK does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of UK will require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.
 * In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers in the UK,
   These scanners do not display private parts (just a stylized outline of a
   body with areas of concern highlighted by squares), but it does
   require the security staff to hit either a pink or blue button
   depending on their estimate of the traveler's body (hitting the wrong
   one can trigger an alarm in a sensitive area of the body). Travelers
   with prosthetics may trigger the alarm, as may be trans people that
   are read as a gender that doesn't match stereotypes about their body
   parts.
 * While some trans travellers have reported that pat downs, when needed
   to resolve metal detector or scanner alarms, have been conducted by
   security staff that does not match their identified gender. However,
   it is often possible to request someone of your identified gender
   conduct the screening.

## Other International Travel

 * Train travel internationally may follow many of the rules indicated
   above for air travel.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women who have a penis are almost always required to be housed in
   men's prisons.
 * Trans women, regardless of genital status, who have been convicted of
   a sexual offense are almost always required to be housed in men's prisons.
 * Trans women, regardless of genital status, who have been convicted of
   a violent offense are almost always required to be housed in men's prisons.
 * For trans prisoners not covered by the above requirements to be
   housed in men's prisons, the prison system may or may not respect the
   prisoner's own safety concerns when making housing decisions.
 * Trans women who are not allowed to be housed in a women's prison may
   be housed in a "specialist unit."
 * The prison service does not recognize non-binary identity.
 * Trans prisoners have reported misgendering and lack of appropriate
   hygiene items when housed according to assignment at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Binary trans people can change their gender identification on passports and
driver's licenses after meeting certain requirements. Additional
requirements are required to have your identified gender listed on
birth, death, or marriage documents. Note that UK does not recognize
updated gender markers from most places which allow "self-ID" for the
purposes of birth, death, or marriage documents.

Non-binary gender is not recognized in the UK.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * NHS clinics typically refer trans-related medical patients to
   specialty units. These units can have extremely long wait times (many
   years).
 * Puberty blockers and hormone therapy is generally not available to
   youth (under 18) at NHS-run clinics.
 * Private trans care is available in the UK
 * Youth trans care is highly contested in the UK and is an area that is
   seeing a shift away from affirming the gender of trans youth. While
   youth care is available, parents should be aware of this and ensure
   any health needs of their children can be met while visiting UK.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not considered child abuse.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Equality Act of
   2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents)
 * [Transgender Prison
   Policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-transgender-prisoner-policy-comes-into-force)

## General Safety

UK, like many countries, is diverse and different areas may be more or
less accepting of gender variation. However, trans people are legally
protected and generally safe. However, in some cases harassment or even
violent attack (typically unarmed or knife attacks) may occur.  Unlike the
US, gun crime is rare in the UK, which provides some safety compared to the
US.

There is a high awareness of the existence of trans persons in UK, due
to extensive (often transphobic) media coverage. This may prime some
people to engage in transphobia towards trans people. That said,
violence or harassment on the basis of legally protected characteristics
("gender reassignment") is against the law in the UK.  While transphobic
beliefs are not particularly widespread, some of the views are very
loudly expressed, through well-funded transphobic media organizations.
