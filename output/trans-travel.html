</nav></section> <section id='file-1'><h1 id="toc-1">Introduction</h1>

<p>This project seeks to provide "travel advice" for trans travelers
(and our companions) based on laws and practical
safety within various jurisdictions.</p>

<p>If you are viewing this at
<a href="https://TravelWhileTrans.com/">https://TravelWhileTrans.com/</a>,
you can select a jurisdiction using the sidebar on the left. On mobile,
you can click the "three bars" on the top left of the page which will
pull out the sidebar (or turn your phone sideways).</p>

<p>It is not geared towards people already living in a jurisdiction.
For instance, laws about medical insurance won't
generally be mentioned, as most people traveling will have
out-of-jurisdiction medical insurance. Likewise, laws about school
athletics will not be mentioned as these generally don't impact
travelers.  However, information that might impact travelers in
different situation will be mentioned. For instance, someone assigned to
a business project for several months in a state may need to utilize
medical care. Others may travel with children and be concerned about how
this could be seen as child abuse or cause child custody issues.</p>

<h1 id="toc-2">Other Formats</h1>

<p>This is also available as a PDF. This may be particularly useful to
people needing to cite this information or who want to carry a copy with
them on their mobile device.  You can access the PDF version at
<a href="https://TravelWhileTrans.com/output/trans-travel.pdf]">https://TravelWhileTrans.com/output/trans-travel.pdf</a>.</p>

<h1 id="toc-3">Disclaimer</h1>

<p>This is not legal advice, and is not put together by a lawyer.  This
information is not guaranteed to be up-to-date or accurate.  You
should consult with an attorney with any questions.</p>

<h1 id="toc-4">Missing Jurisdictions</h1>

<p>This guide is definitely incomplete, and contains only a handful of
jurisdictions at this time.  Contributions of additional jurisdictions
are always appreciated.</p>

<h1 id="toc-5">A Note on Intersectional Oppression</h1>

<p>This directory is focused on laws and safety concerns that generally
impact trans people. However, not all trans people have the same safety
concerns, which is why I've refrained from saying a state might be
"safe" or "dangerous" directly, or giving scores/grades/etc.  For
instance, a wealthy trans person may be able to more safely visit a
specific jurisdiction than someone without class privilege. Likewise, a
person with white privilege might be safe in a place where a person who
does not have that privilege might not.  The intent is to not erase
these legitimate intersectional concerns, but to be a starting point for
your research.</p>

<h1 id="toc-6">Changes to this guide</h1>

<p>You can <a href="#file-66">view changes to the travel guide here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="toc-7">About "Bad Countries" and "Bad States"</h1>

<p>Trans people have always existed, and still do exist across all
cultures. A jurisdiction may be unsafe or have bad laws, but there will
still be trans people within that jurisdiction, and it's important to
consider them before fully writing off a state or country as not worth a
fight. In addition, there are accepting, open-minded allies in every
jurisdiction as well.</p>

<p>In addition, in both good and bad jurisdictions, there will be good and
bad treatment of trans people. The summaries in this project attempt to
summarize the situation for people, but they are just summaries. Any one
individual's situation may be different than what others face, both good
and bad.</p>

<h1 id="toc-8">Errors / Omissions</h1>

<p>This project welcomes contributions via pull requests or email to
Joelle Maslak <a href="mailto:jmaslak@antelope.net">jmaslak@antelope.net</a>.</p>

<p>The project is also available on Github as <a
href="https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel">https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel</a></p>

<p>Particularly interesting is general information from people that know
the location, beyond just what the laws say. If you know a city has a
great neighborhood for trans people, or that there is a disparity
between how one area of the country or state treats people and another,
this is extremely valuable information!</p>

<p>This project also welcomes contributions of new jurisdictions!
To add a new jurisdiction, please utilize the template in template.md if
you can.</p>

</section><section id='file-5'><h1 id="toc-11">Canada - British Columbia</h1>

<p>British Columbia recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some purposes. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws
are positive and there is non-discrimination protection for trans people.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in British Columbia non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in British Columbia.</li>
<li>Anti-trans/anti-gay extremists attempt to disrupt LGBT events such as
<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9411397/drag-queen-story-time-protest-coquitlam-bc/">drag queen storytime
events</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.</p>

<p>Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans prisoners can be housed in British Columbia prisons on the basis of
gender identity rather than sex assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96210_01">British Columbia Human Rights
Code</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in British Columbia, although this
is less supported by residents than this activity would be in much of the USA.</p>

<p>Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Ontario, although this
is less supported than in much of the USA. Much of this anti-trans
activity occurs as "protest" towards Pride events that include youth.
It also may occur in Ottawa as a "protest" against inclusive government
policies.</p>

<p>One local contributor noted that the Kitchener/Waterloo/Cambridge area, being
largely a university town, is a comparatively safe space, though there
will always be pockets of what I'll politely call radicalized members.
Of late there have been smaller hate groups mobilizing to attempt to get
their own onto school boards and municipal legislation for the obvious
reasons, but thus far (updated on Sept. 17, 2023) to no avail.</p>

</section><section id='file-8'><h1 id="toc-14">Mexico</h1>

<h2>A Note</h2>

<p>An American with limited knowledge of Mexican law and culture, and who
does not speak Spanish put this page together. I would be very grateful
for those with more knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.
While this is geared for people who might travel to Mexico, I prefer
that it would written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While Mexico does not specifically name trans people in
non-discrimination law, they appear to be protected under the law by
CONAPRED, the group responsible for enforcing the national
anti-discrimination law.</p>

<p>Mexico does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>CONAPRED, the Mexican non-discrimination agency, does appear to
consider anti-transgender discrimination to be a violation of Mexican
anti-discrimination law, although the law does not specifically
mention trans people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
rooms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mexico does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Travel into/out-of Mexico will require tickets and documents to
match, including gender.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women would typically be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men would typically be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people have recently obtained legal recognition, although this
change is a work in progress and is at the early stages.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Medical tourism is a large industry in Mexico. Some clinics are
reputable and operate with high standards within regulations, while
others are operating outside of the law and may target medical
tourists, providing unsafe care.</li>
<li>Care for transgender youth may not be as easily available as it is in
some places in the USA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Mexico is a large country, with a variety of different cultures. Some of
these cultures have a long heritage of people who do not fit the gender
binary, but others are resistant to trans people. Trans people in
Mexico face discrimination and violence. Standard travel warnings from
various governments should also be followed when visiting any country,
including Mexico.</p>

<h2>A Note</h2>

<p>An American with limited knowledge of Aotearoa / NZ law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to Aotearoa / NZ, I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While Aotearoa / NZ does not specifically name trans people in non-discrimination
law, they appear to be protected under the 1993 Human Rights Act, under
the grounds of "sex" discrimination.</p>

<p>The LGBT community may be referred to as the "rainbow community" here.</p>

<p>Aotearoa / NZ does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>While the 1993 Human Rights Act does not specifically name trans
people, it is believed to protect against anti-trans discrimination
in the same ways it protects against sex discrimination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people can use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. Note
however that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
However, a trans person can use a toilet that best fits their
identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aotearoa / NZ does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Travel into/out-of Aotearoa / NZ will require tickets and documents to
match, including gender.</li>
<li>As of at least Sept. 21, 2023, body scanners are used for travelers
who fail to pass through a metal detector without alarming. These
scanners do not display private parts (just a stylized outline of a
body with areas of concern highlighted by squares), but it does
require the security staff to hit either a pink or blue button
depending on their estimate of the traveler's body (hitting the wrong
one can trigger an alarm in a sensitive area of the body). Travelers
with prosthetics may trigger the alarm, as may be trans people that
are read as a gender that doesn't match stereotypes about their body

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Aotearoa / NZ is a country with a variety of different cultures. Some of
these cultures have a long heritage of people who <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/gender-diversity/page-4">do not fit the gender
binary</a>, but others are
more resistant to trans people, in some cases due to the impact of
colonization. Trans people in Aotearoa / NZ face some discrimination, but
tend to face less violence than in the United States.</p>

<p>While there is a history of support for trans people, including the
<a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/georgina-beyer-becomes-first-transgender-woman-elected-parliament">first openly trans minister of parliament in the
world</a>,
recent world-wide "culture wars" have begun making some inroads into New
Zealand. While these are not predominant beliefs, and most residents
appear to reject them, some politicians have begun to <a href="https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/08/17/exclude-trans-women-from-womens-bathrooms-threaten-sports-funding-nz-first/">campaign on
transphobic policies</a>
as of 2023. In addition, anti-trans protesters have been active, fueled
by international anti-trans hate, with <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/08/posie-parker-kellie-jay-keen-minshull-anti-trans-online-hate/">anti-trans hate rhetoric increasing in
2023</a>.
That said, at major hate events, counter-protesters (I.E. people supporting
trans rights) have, thus far (as of September, 2023), outnumbered hate
group members.</p>

<p>In general, more protections exist for trans people in Aotearoa / NZ
than in the United States, particularly around hate speech and
harassment. Like many places, larger cities are said to be more
accepting than some rural places, although trans visitors are generally
unlikely to directly encounter explicit, directed hate in any area of
the country.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 18 has passed and became law.  It is, as of Aug. 28,
2023, initially blocked from enforcement by a district judge, although an
appeals court ruled in favor of the block but that decision <a href="https://www.glad.org/update-on-federal-challenge-to-al-transgender-medical-care-ban/">cannot

conspiracy</a>.
That law is similar to the anti-trans youth healthcare ban, thus people
should be aware that when visiting Alabama, many actions that don't

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, much of California is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the major cities where many people are visibly trans. That said, attacks
still can and do occur in California, particularly around school board
meetings discussing LGBT policies and schools teaching LGBT schools. For
instance, LGBT supporters at Saticoy Elementary in North Hollywood were
attacked by anti-LGBT protesters (who also used anti-Semitic language),
leaving one LGBT supporter unresponsive during the protest <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/saticoy-elementary-school-pride-assembly-protest-erupts-in-violence">on June 2,
2023</a>.
Rural areas may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some
jurisdictions outside of the major metro areas have attempted to restrict
the rights of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries. For
instance, an elected official uses his social media platform to <a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/shasta-county-office-of-education-board-member-faces-possible-censure">misgender a trans
constituent</a>
Murrieta Valley School District <a href="https://www.advocate.com/education/murrieta-valley-outing-transgender-students">approved transphobic
policies</a>,
and Chino Valley School District has approved anti-LGBT policies.  Thus it is
important to recognize that California is not unified and does not have a
single view of trans people.</p>

<p>In addition, beyond political events and education, other violence has
occurred in California, sometimes not being restricted to the queer
community, but also impacting allies, such as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/20/1194932544/lauri-carleton-california-store-owner-killed-pride-flag-lgbtq">murder of a
66-year-old mother of nine because the shooter disliked her pride
flag</a>
that she was flying at her shop in support of the LGBT community. Thus,
like in most of the USA, care should be taken when displaying visible
symbols of the LGBT community.</p>

<p>Colorado recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.</p>

<p>Colorado is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Colorado non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
<li>In 2023, a law was passed that requires all government buildings with
single-user bathrooms must sign them gender-neutrally as of July 1,
2024 and newly-built government buildings must have at least one neutral
restroom per floor. After July 1, 2025, all government buildings must
have one per floor. Note that this includes colleges and universities
but not K12 schools.</li>
<li>Denver and Boulder have ordinances requiring single-user bathrooms to
be signed as gender neutral.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Colorado.</li>
<li>Drag shows in Colorado, particularly G-rated shows open to all ages,
have been the target of armed protests, intimidation, and threats. In
general, law enforcement has sided with the extremists, citing freedom
of speech and Colorado's open carry laws, and do not generally
enforce laws against implied violent threats and intimidation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-65">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While most jails/prisons have regulations that, in theory, would
consider gender identity in housing decisions, these regulations are
often ignored and trans people are often housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Colorado.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in Colorado.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Colorado will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Colorado for medical transition.</li>
<li>Some providers (notably Children's Hospital) have cut back on
transition care, including <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/18/childrens-hospital-colorado-transgender-surgery/?share=se0slhdorisewirvhdgy">cutting back on care for people over
age 18</a>.
While the stated reason is to ensure they have capacity for children
under 18, the obvious reason is so they can deny that surgeries are
being done at Children's Hospital (since they do not do surgeries for
anyone under 18, cutting off 18+ people, despite 18+ people routinely
getting care at Children's for other needs, this eliminated all
surgeries).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Colorado has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Colorado</li>
<li>Colorado will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Colorado will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Colorado via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ccrd.colorado.gov/ccrd-home/regulatory-information">Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, much of Colorado is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the Denver/Boulder metro area where many people are visibly trans. That
said, attacks still can and do occur in Colorado.  Rural areas
may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some jurisdictions
outside of the Denver/Boulder metro have attempted to restrict the rights
of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries.  In addition,
some suburbs in the Denver metro area have shown willingness to attempt
to restrict LGBT representation (Douglas County in particular, although
Jefferson County has also recently, as of August 10, 2023, begun to
implement new transphobic policies in school systems, such as
restricting teachers from asking for pronouns). Thus travelers should be
aware that "near Denver" is not necessarily as supportive as Denver.</p>

<p>LGBT events in Colorado, particularly G-rated drag shows open to all ages,
have been the target of armed right-wing extremists using intimidation and
threats. In general, law enforcement has sided with the extremists, citing
freedom of speech and Colorado's open carry laws, and do not generally
enforce laws against implied violent threats and intimidation. Groups
present at these events include hate groups such as the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys">Proud
Boys</a>
and the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6KunBhDxARIsAKFUGs_F9z9CLMCHyB2fHvrR4JErXRFpIfYQ3PPt-5pRdyBFShbYq7SItdgaApsCEALw_wcB">Patriot
Front</a>.
Targeting tends to focus on small-scale events, such as small town pride
events and drag queen storytimes, while the larger events are largely
free of intimidation. Most recently, this targeting occurred at Douglas
County Pride on August 26, 2023. Drag storytimes have also received bomb
threats, such as at the Lafayette Public Library on Sept. 30, 2023.
An anti-LGBT group protested Fountain's October 2023 pride event, which
included attempts to provoke LGBT-friendly counter-protesters into
violence.</p>

<p>HRC and Equality Florida, LGBT advocacy groups, have issued an advisory travel
warning for the State of Florida.  In addition, both LULAC and NAACP
have also issued advisories.  Finally, SPARTA, a transgender military
advocacy group has also issued a duty assignment warning for Florida.</p>

<p>Florida has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>People visiting Florida, including connecting to outbound flights and/or
cruises, should be aware of the laws that may apply to them.</p>

<p>Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction, although it is not yet (or
proposed to be under pending legislation) legally considered child
abuse.  Florida's youth care ban also allows the Florida courts to have
emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it is necessary in an emergency
to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or is
threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or
procedures," similar to how the courts have jurisdiction over abuse.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
include trans people.</li>
<li>Jacksonville's non-discrimination law is being <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/courts/2023/02/24/transgender-debate-sparks-catholic-store-lawsuit-over-jacksonville-hro/69933481007/">challenged by
Alliance Defending Freedom</a> who seeks to allow businesses to
require misgendering of customers, on the basis of religious
owners of a for-profit corporation.</li>
<li>Public school (K12) employees are required to use pronouns and titles
associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth. This is being

law</a>.</li>
<li>Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
these organizations. However (information current on October 11,
2023), a court is preventing the state from enforcing the drag ban.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Florida.</li>
<li>There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies,
schools, universities, etc.</li>
<li>The bathroom law will apply to airports and cruise ports, in addition
to other government facilities. It also applies to highway rest
areas, which are state owned.</li>
<li>Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Trans women are being challenged for using bathrooms not covered by
the Florida law, including federal facilities <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/florida-veteran-transgender-bathroom">such as the
VA</a>,
even before the Florida law goes into effect. The challenges are often
other bathroom users objecting to the presence of trans women in the
bathroom, after which business/organization staff, security, or police
force the trans person to leave. This is regardless of the user's legal
identification, length of time on HRT, etc.</li>
<li>Visitors to schools, such as parents and family members, will be
covered by the educational laws and be required to be misgendered by
school staff and forced to use improper bathrooms.</li>
<li>The bathroom law is <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/09/29/transgender-nonbinary-group-sues-florida-in-federal-court-over-new-bathroom-restrictions/">being challenged in
court</a>
as of September 30, 2023.</li>
<li>The Florida Dept. of Education has also <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20680/urlt/8-2.pdf">enacted
rules</a>
to ban trans people from bathrooms and locker rooms at private
colleges and universities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
drag performances where minors were present.</li>
<li>Florida has a "protection of children" law that bans "lewd conduct"
and similar activities outside of venues such as strip clubs that are
licensed for the purpose and only permit adults. This has been
labeled a drag ban, and depending on how courts interpret various
phrases may or may not actually be one. However, a court case, as of
June 24, 2023, prevents the state from enforcing this law.</li>
<li>Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
these organizations. However, see the above bullet point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-65">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies, etc.</li>
<li>This law would apply to airport and cruise port bathrooms, so trans people
and families should use caution connecting through Florida airports
and cruise ports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women must be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men must be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Local jails have housed at least one cis woman in men's jail after
mistaking her for a trans woman.</li>
<li>As public funds cannot be used for transition care, trans prisoners
will not have access to trans-related medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Florida will defines sex largely consistent with sex assigned at birth
for a large number of interactions trans travelers may have. Birth
certificates, IDs, genital configurations, etc, will not take priority
over sex assigned at birth.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults, but this is potentially at
risk and is subject to significant restriction.</li>
<li>Nurse practitioners and telehealth providers are not allowed to
provide HRT in Florida. This has resulted in a shortage of providers
that can provide HRT to adults.</li>
<li>Florida also requires <a href="https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2023-07-24/trans-advocates-new-informed-consent-forms-transphobic-inaccurate">misleading "HRT consent"
forms</a>
for adult HRT treatment</li>
<li>Final rules for adults seeking trans medical care will likely be
extremely restrictive, requiring, among other things, annual bone
scans and four blood tests per year.</li>
<li>Medical transition for people under age 18 is illegal. However,
a judge's ruling in Doe v. Ladapo is allowing 3 trans children to
continue receiving medical care.  However, this ruling does not apply
to other children or to adults, and the case is still pending. That
said, GLAD, a legal advocacy group, reports that because much of the
law was found unconstitutional, <a href="https://www.glad.org/questions-about-the-legal-status-of-floridas-transgender-healthcare-ban/">trans care is legal again in
Florida</a>.</li>
<li>The Doe v. Ladapo case, as of July 23, 2023, is now expanded to
include litigation on adult care.  However, at this time, health care
for adults is still significantly restricted.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny most care on the basis of their religious
or ethical beliefs (emergency care is required to be provided).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is a law against trans medical care for youth in Florida
(but see above).</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.  However, Florida's youth care ban also allows the
Florida courts to have emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it
is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child
has been subjected to or is threatened with being subjected to
sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures," similar to how the
courts have jurisdiction over abuse.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>HRC and Equity Florida have issued a joint
<a href="https://floridatraveladvisory.com/">travel warning</a>
for the State of Florida due to anti-LGBT legislation.  The
<a href="https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida">NAACP</a>,
<a href="https://lulac.org/news/pr/LULACS_HISTORIC_WARNING_AGAINST_LATINOS_TRAVELING_TO_FLORIDA_IS_A_REMINDER_OF_ARIZONA_FOLLOWING_SB1070/">LULAC</a>
(a Latino advocacy organization), the
<a href="https://floridatraveladvisory.com/">Florida Immigrant Commission</a>, and
<a href="https://spartapride.org/duty-assignment-warning-issued-for-florida/">SPARTA</a>
(a transgneder servicemember advocacy organization)
have also done so, for state-sponsored attacks against their
constituents' human rights.</p>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools.  Local officials have
broadly applied this law, including using the law as justification for
censoring <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/01/seminole-schools-offer-to-remove-lgbtq-pages-from-high-school-yearbook/?fbclid=IwAR0h7CGbTNdU8oXtyBdg872dGf0E9VcGFln6h2m8TafunxsZ_FJNaVKXpas">student speech</a>.</p>

<p>Some state officials consider exposure of children to sexual orientation or
gender identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.</p>

<p>Florida has taken moves to <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/16/fdle-cracks-down-on-transgender-rights-protesters-2-months-after-panty-toss/">arrest peaceful
protesters</a>
months after protests against government officials. These protesters
were involved in LGBT, immigrant, civil rights, and reproductive justice
protests at government buildings. They did not damage property or use
violence. Those arrested included current and former government
officials.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Recent attacks on trans girls/women have been reported in (note links
discuss violent crimes against trans people)
<a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/man-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-transgender-woman-in-miami-bar/">bathrooms</a>,

<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jenny-deleon-florida-hillsborough-county-sheriff-choking_n_634ee621e4b0e376dc114d95">police officers</a>.
In addition, at least one trans person has recently been
<a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/08/11/brevard-public-schools-dismiss-reports-transgender-school-assault/10297179002/">wrongfully accused</a>
of sexually assaulting others in bathrooms by Florida politicians.</p>

<p>Fernandina Beach's city council, like other cities, passed a 2023
proclamation recognition Transgender Day of Remembrance.  However the
mayor and some city council members claimed the proclamation was
"political" and <a href="https://www.fbnewsleader.com/index.php/local-newsletter/mayor-steps-away-transgender-recognition">refused to support
it</a>.</p>

<p>That said, locals have indicated larger cities tend to be more inclusive
than rural areas, and southern Florida more inclusive than northern
Florida.  One city, Lake Worth Beach, has passed <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/lake-worth-beach-sanctuary-city-lgbtq-community-floridas-first-gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender-9-6-2023">a sanctuary
resolution</a>,
although that resolution will have limited power due to state law and
the ability and willingness of the state to remove local prosecutors who
do not enforce discriminatory state laws.</p>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized by Georgia.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Medical care for transgender children is restricted. While puberty
blockers are legal, hormone therapy and surgery are illegal.</li>
<li>The youth healthcare ban is being <a href="https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/press-release-georgia-parents-seek-emergency-court-order-blocking-anti-transgender">challenged in

custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other

</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Georgia has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using hormone replacement therapy.</p>

<p>A "Don't say gay" bill <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB88/id/2679859">banning discussion of student's sexual
orientation, student's gender identity, or sexual education
topics</a> without written
parental permission in schools until Age 16 has been re-introduced during an
out-of-session committee meeting in August, 2023. While this is not law,
visitors who may be presenting material in Georgia schools should keep
track of this law. The proposed, but not passed, bill also requires student
names to be maintained under their initial enrollment name, reflecting a
possible belief by legislatures that other types of name changes (such
as changing a last name to avoid association with an abuser) are not
appropriate for children.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, there are visible LGBT communities in some cities (Atlanta,
Savannah) which may have some degree of safety.  This is
in-spite of the law, not because of the law. Atlanta's leaders, in particular,
has given <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/atlanta-mayor-dickens-transgender-community-funding">public support to trans
people</a></p>

<p>Police departments in Georgia may inaccurately gender crime victims (for
instance, <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/deputies-identify-23-year-old-found-shot-death-empty-parking-lot/BXOK2FMBQZHIXDLGGGWLAPKYTA/">Macon Police misgendered a trans woman murder

</section><section id='file-21'><h1 id="toc-26">USA - Hawaii</h1>

<p>Hawaii recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.</p>

<p>Hawaii does not appear to place child custody at risk.</p>

<p>Note that colonization disrupted Hawaiian culture significantly,
significantly impacting Māhū, or "people in the middle," who today
sometimes (but not always) also refer to themselves as trans.  Many
indigenous Hawaiians view tourism today as continuing the colonization
of Hawaii and ask tourists without connections to indigenous Hawaii
to plan vacations to places other than Hawaii, because of the harm that
will be done by this continuing form of colonization.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Hawaii non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are usually housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men are usually housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
<li>News reports indicate that gender affirming care is sub-par or
unavailable in custody.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change driver's licenses but not
birth certificates.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Hawaii does not have a "sanctuary law" protecting people receiving

trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered

<p>However, much of Hawaii is considered reasonably safe. Indigenous
Hawaiians culture recognized people who were Māhū or "in the middle."
As a result, there is some familiarity with non-cis gender expression.
However, due to the impact of Christianity and colonialism, prejudice
exists both within and outside of indigenous culture in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Idaho has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

<p>Idaho does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody. However, this is currently stayed by judicial
order pending ongoing legislation.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Idaho non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>According to law, trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers
associated with their sex assigned at birth when using some
bathrooms/showers in schools. However, this is <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/08/10/u-s-district-court-temporarily-blocks-enforcement-of-idaho-transgender-bathroom-law/">being
challenged</a> in
court and a temporary restraining order against this law, thus
bathroom/shower access in schools is temporarily allowed in Idaho, as
of August 10, 2023.  Note however that this only blocks this <em>state</em>
law, and does not block any local school policies that are discriminatory,
as those aren't at issue in the lawsuit.</li>
<li>Enforcement of school bathroom regulations is unclear. But see above,
as the law is temporarily stayed.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Idaho.</li>
<li>Idaho has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Idaho has a law that prevents all levels of government from enforcing
any bathroom non-discrimination laws upon businesses and organizations
that contract with government. (Example: homeless shelters,
businesses that contract with the state, private schools that get
state money, etc).</li>
<li>Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
but it is unclear how that is reconciled with state law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

confirmation surgery to a prisoner, it should be expected that
medical care will be sub-par. The state also aggressively fought to
deny care, and would be expected to do so in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws define sex essentially in line with sex assigned at birth.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not generally recognized (with minor exceptions).</p>

<p>Intersex people have some recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>

</section><section id='file-23'><h1 id="toc-28">USA - Illinois</h1>

<p>Illinois recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men. However, while non-binary people
lack some recognition (for instance, until 2024, will be unable to get
an "X" marker on their license), most laws are positive and there is
non-discrimination protection for trans people.</p>

<p>Illinois is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Illinois non-discrimination laws.</li>
<li>Illinois has a religious freedom law that may provide religious exemptions
to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-65">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans prisoners have typically been housed based on sex assigned at
birth, rather than gender, denied medical care, and mistreated by
guards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
However, non-binary recognition is still in-complete in Illinois.
For example, "X" gender markers are not available on driver's licenses
in Illinois due to <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/25/20832644/pritzker-approves-non-binary-state-id-cards-drivers-licenses">bureaucratic reasons</a>
(the law allows this but the
company the state's current contract is with does not allow it).</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Illinois will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Illinois for medical transition.</li>
<li>There is a religious exemption law that applies to limited medical
situations in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Illinois has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Illinois</li>
<li>Illinois will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Illinois will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Illinois via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>

<p>Indiana does criminalize trans care for children which may have an

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade six in schools.</p>

<p>Essex, a small town near Shanandooah, has <a href="https://www.kmaland.com/news/aclu-demands-shenandoah-prides-inclusion-in-essex-parade/article_8c16ccb0-4a64-11ee-85be-9b933dd52bdd.html">banned an LGBT
organization</a>
from participating in a city parade, saying that the parade "will not be
used for and will not allow sexual identification or sexual orientation
agendas for, or against, to be promoted." This may indicate predominant
(or at least significant) attitudes towards LGBT people.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Kansas places trans people at risk by not recognizing any gender other
than sex assigned at birth, regardless of legal documentation changes in
Kansas or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Trans travelers should use extreme caution in Kansas due to 2023 SB180 (The
badly named "Women's Bill of Rights"). Kansas requires all state
agencies to treat all trans women as men, all trans men as women, and
all non-binary people on the basis of their sex assigned at birth. This
has wide-ranging implications, such as improper incarceration, bathroom
access, identifications, etc.</p>

<p>Kansas does not appear to place child custody at risk.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kansas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>The State is required under 2023 SB180 to discriminate against trans
people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because of Kansas's law defining sex legally (note that the law does
not mention bathrooms directly), it may be interpreted by courts, in
combination with other laws, to ban trans people from appropriate
bathrooms. This is the opinion held by the Attorney General, so it is
likely to be followed by state agencies.</li>
<li>Trans women are required to use male facilities such
as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.</li>
<li>Trans men are required to use women's facilities such
as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.</li>
<li>Non-binary people are required to use facilities
based on sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
but the state law will override many of these protections.</li>
<li>At least one religious-based shelter enforces a rule which bans any
trans person <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/local/2023/09/14/topeka-homeless-shelter-explains-policy-for-transgender-and-nonbinary-residents/70826076007/">which makes residents
"uncomfortable"</a>.
This has been enforced against non-binary AFAB people in a women's
shelter who were criticized for wearing boxers and being seen "with a
bulge" (the person involved did not wear a packer at the shelter).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is unknown how this would be enforced, beyond where the state has the
power to impose gender determination on people. It is likely that, for
instance, a trans woman using a women's bathroom could be charged with
other crimes that do carry a penalty on the basis that the state
prohibits her from being in the space.</p>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Currently, no ban on drag performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-65">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is illegal to use a bathroom that does not match your sex
assigned at birth in Kansas airports (note that Kansas City
Airport - MCI - is in Missouri, not Kansas, and thus this law does
not apply to the Kansas City Airport)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are required to be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are required to be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is not possible to change the sex on your birth certificate or
driver's license in Kansas.</li>
<li>sex = "biological sex, either male or female, at birth"</li>
<li>female = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
to produce ova"</li>
<li>male = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
to fertilize the ova of a female"</li>
<li>woman = "human females"</li>
<li>girl = "human females"</li>
<li>man = "human male"</li>
<li>boy = "human male"</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people who are "born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of
'disorder/differences in sex development'" should be considered disabled
and provided accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

<p>The Attorney General has issued an opinion requiring state agencies to
re-issue driver's licenses and birth certificates where they have been
changed because a person is transgender. The re-issued licenses and
certificates would indicate the sex assigned at birth. The Governor
disagrees with this interpretation and has made some indications
(but not official executive orders) that she will direct agencies to
continue to not re-issue documents with sex assigned at birth, but a
state court thus far has agreed with the attorney general, overruling
the Governor (as of July 10, 2023).</p>

<p>Note that these laws while targeting trans people also place gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Some communities may be more welcoming than others. For instance,
Lawrence was indicated as a welcoming city and has passed an ordinance
that <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2023/07/18/lawrencecitycomm-approves-ord9999/">prohibits collecting sex assigned at
birth</a>
or otherwise cooperating with 2023 SB180.</p>

<p>Bathroom access is a significant issue in Kansas.  Already, in May
2023, the same month the trans-exclusionary definition of sex was
enacted, a cis woman in a public library who was assisting her
non-verbal son use the bathroom was
<a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/05/23/amid-anti-trans-law-kansas-woman-son-asked-to-leave-library-restroom/70245966007/">kicked out of the women's bathroom</a>,
which she believes is connected to SB180 (prior to the passage of SB180,
they had used the bathroom for years). The son's presence was also
objected to by another bathroom user in addition to library staff,
showing that this policing bathrooms is on the mind of Kansas citizens.
Note that in addition to these actions, these laws while targeting trans
people also place gender non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive
questioning and state action.</p>

<p>Beyond bathrooms, hostility against rainbow symbols, even rainbow
symbols that have nothing to do with the LGBT community (such as the
neurodiversity pride symbol, which is a rainbow-colored infinity symbol,
but is not about gender or sexuality), which <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kansas-town-axed-librarians-confusing-162943798.html">one county
banned</a>
at a library (the Sterling library).  Another library, Andover Library,
<a href="https://www.ksn.com/news/local/andover-public-library-goes-dark-on-social-media-after-banned-book-display-leads-to-threats/">received
threats</a>
after posting information about a banned books week display on their
social media (the display included <em>Gender Queer</em>).</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Should a trans person interact with state government, they should be
expected to be treated in every way based on their sex assigned at
birth. Note that law enforcement generally has access to previous
identification issued in other states, and thus having identification
changed in another state is likely not sufficient to protect a trans
person.</p>

<p>Kentucky negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

<p>Under a law that is currently (last checked Sept. 15, 2023) in effect (due to
actions of an appeals court in the Tennessee case) that criminalizes
hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgery,
Kentucky does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kentucky non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
Lexington-Fayette County and Louisville-Jefferson County.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.</li>
<li>Kentucky has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
many services on the basis of gender identity.</li>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While Kentucky has a policy that they will not house trans prisoners
in State prisons based on "genital status alone," genital status remains a
consideration, as do many other factors (of which the trans person's
gender is at best a minor concern).</li>
<li>The State does provide some trans medical care in prisons, although
it appears this does not meet the current WPATH standard of care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 18 has passed and became law. It was initially blocked
by court, but that block has been invalidated due to a decision by
the US appeals court (last checked on September 15, 2023).</li>
<li>Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
law applies only to medical providers.</li>
<li>Medical providers may be allowed to deny some care on the basis of
their religious beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
for children is illegal. This ban shows the state's view of this care. That said,
puberty blockers and hormone therapy is currently allowed under a
preliminary injunction as noted above.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) in any grade, although the
legislative guidance by the Kentucky Department of Education is
that a district that does not teach sexuality or STDs to children before
grade six can teach about sexual orientation and gender identity, due to
a possible legislative error (using "or" when the legislature likely
meant "and").</p>

<p>Kentucky has a history of interpreting religious exemptions very widely
when discrimination occurs against LGBT people.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Nebraska's executive order defining men and women based on sex assigned
at birth creates an openly hostile state for trans travelers. This law
does not depend upon surgical status, genitals, government ID, birth
certificate, or any other "proof" of transition, and is wide-ranging
across all state government programs and services.</p>

<p>Nebraska has seen very widely publicized hate crimes against LGBT
people.  While these crimes may occur anywhere, and most anti-LGBT hate
crimes, even of the severity of the notorious crimes committed in NE,
are not publicized when they occur (and, again, can and do occur nearly
everywhere in the USA), this may be a concern to some travelers.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>North Dakota does criminalizes trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>North Dakota non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people.</li>
<li>North Dakota's definition of sex law (HB1474) makes it unlikely that
non-discrimination laws specifying "sex" would be interpreted in a
trans-inclusive way. Note that this also places gender non-conforming cis
women at risk of invasive questioning and state action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when visiting public educational dormitories.</li>
<li>Trans students are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using school bathrooms.</li>
<li>Use of single-occupancy bathrooms by trans students (as an exception) in
schools requires parental permission in writing.</li>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms associated with their sex
assigned at birth when visiting jails, prisons, youth correctional
centers, etc.</li>
<li>Government employees (including school) cannot be be disciplined for
misgendering others.</li>
<li>Students in schools cannot be disciplined for misgendering others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exposure of prosthetic genitals, breasts, or buttocks, partial or
completely, during "performance" (does not need to be paid) is
illegal. I.E. seeing the top part (above nipples) of prosthetic
breasts may be criminal. These do not need to be attached to a human
to be illegal (I.E. Truck Nutz may be illegal now). This applies in
public and in any space where minors may be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-65">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bathrooms and showers are required to be legally segregated by sex
assigned at birth in state jails and prisons</li>
<li>Trans women would typically be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men would typically be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<p>North Dakota specifies male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Note that this also places gender non-conforming cis women at risk of
invasive questioning and state action.</p>

<p>North Dakota prohibits trans people changing birth certificates.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under
18, with some exceptions for people currently receiving care prior to
the enactment of HB 1254 (2023) -- but only for those procedures they
were receiving prior to enactment.</li>
<li>It is a criminal act in North Dakota to supply HRT or puberty
blocking medication to most trans minors, which may have implications
for people traveling with trans children on puberty blockers or HRT.</li>
<li>The trans youth medical care ban is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-gender-affirming-care-transgender-7d060639419ec27629003819c226ab04">being challenged in
court</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery is considered illegal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>While the laws in ND impact trans people negatively, there is some signs
of resistance.  For instance the <a href="https://www.valleynewslive.com/2023/05/10/fargo-public-schools-superintendent-speaks-out-recent-lgbtq-related-legislation/">Fargo School Board has indicated they
will ignore a law that requires outing students to their
(potentially non-supportive) parents</a>.</p>

<p>Anti-LGBT opposition has occurred around LGBT events. For instance, an
anti-trans hate group is opposing a Fargo salon doing a <a href="https://www.wdayradionow.com/news/local-news/70621-gays-against-groomers-leader-speaks-out-against-fargo-salon-hosting">trans inclusive
beauty
workshop</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Oklahoma has negative laws towards trans people. Some of these laws may
place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>Oklahoma's executive branch considers sex and gender to be synonyms of
sex assigned at birth. This applies to government facilities and
processes, such as restrooms managed by the state government.</p>

<p>Oklahoma does criminalize trans care for children, but does not penalize
parents (the law applies to medical providers).  However, it is unknown
how this might have an impact on child custody.</p>

<p>Note that some indigenous nations within the boundaries of Oklahoma may
ban same-sex marriage recognition for people receiving services from
these nations (but this does not generally apply to non-native
visitors).</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Oklahoma state executive branch government is required to treat trans
women as men, trans men as women, and non-binary people on the basis
of their sex assigned at birth.  Note this also places gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</li>
<li>Oklahoma non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people.</li>
<li>Norman, OK has a non-discrimination law locally.</li>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in both
schools and locations under the authority of the executive branch of
state government.  Note that this also places gender non-conforming
cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state action.</li>

<li>Medical care (HRT) has been discontinued for at least one prisoner
due to prison staff believing she was "faking" being transgender.</li>
<li>Medical care other than HRT is not generally provided (by policy).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Under executive order, all executive branch government departments must
consider a person's gender and sex to be the same as their sex assigned
at birth. This applies to "single sex facilities" under executive branch
control, such as bathrooms.  Note that this also places gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</p>

<p>Trans people cannot change their identification or birth certificate in
Oklahoma.</p>

<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Oklahoma, although parents

<li>The Cherokee Nation and Chickasaw Nations recognize same-sex
marriage.</li>
<li>Some indigenous nations (Muscogee/Creek Nation, Choctaw Nation,
and Seminole Nation) within the boundaries of Oklahoma have banned
recognition of same-sex marriage, although this only applies to
people receiving services from these nations (I.E. most visitors
are not impacted by these bans). It is unknown how the "sex" of
trans people would be seen under these laws, potentially placing some
trans/cis marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as some queer
marriages.</li>

<p>Puerto Rico has negative laws towards trans people. These laws should generally
not impact adult travelers to Puerto Rico, although Puerto Rico also lacks many
non-discrimination protections.</p>

<p>Puerto Rico does criminalize some trans care for children (hormone therapy
and surgery).</p>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Puerto Rico has few protections for trans people.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>While Puerto Rick has <a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/regional-reports-puerto-rico/">high incidence of anti-trans violent
crimes</a>,
and trans victims are frequently misgendered and deadnamed, there is
also some acceptance among others on the island, although the political
rhetoric is fueling an increase in hate crime.</p>

an unknown impact on child custody, however parents are not penalized
under this law (it applies to healthcare providers), except possibly if
one parent provides hormones or puberty blockers without the other
parent's consent. While a preliminary injunction (as of July 8,
2023) would have allowed both puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth
until the case challenging the ban is heard, the appeals court decided
that stay was invalid. However, the plaintiffs in a related case in
Kentucky have asked that the entire appeals court re-hear the Kentucky
appeal, which could have impact in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Tennessee's Attorney General has requested private medical records
(and <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2023/06/20/vanderbilt-university-m-turns-over-transgender-patient-medical-records-to-tennessee-attorney-general/70338356007/">received

<p>Texas has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws could place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>It is important for parents of trans kids to research the current state
positions towards trans healthcare before a trans child visits Texas.
Texas does criminalize trans care for children through law, executive order
and legal opinion by the state's attorney general.
Elected officials in both the executive and legislative branch consider
transition of children to be child abuse. The state has shown willingness to
investigate families solely on the basis of a child's gender transition
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Texas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Cities are substantially banned from passing non-discrimination laws
due to a new law passed in 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Texas.</li>
<li>Texas has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Some cities, such as <a href="https://www.ktsm.com/news/city-council-oks-2-resolutions-to-promote-transgender-rights/">El
Paso</a>
are attempting to preserve trans rights to access city facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Texas does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
<li>A law that has vague language that attempted to ban "sexually oriented
performances" where a child might be able to view it and could have been
used against drag performers. This law was being <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/en/cases/woodlands-pride-inc-et-al-v-angela-colmenero-et-al">challenged in
court</a>
and is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300.94.0.pdf">ruled
unconstitutional</a>.
Thus, drag remains legal in Texas.  However, a state university's
drag ban was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677.59.0.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">allowed to
stand by a local judge</a>
as the judge saw no right to perform drag. So while people cannot
prosecute drag performers or venues, at least some organizations will be
able to declare that the first amendment does not include drag and thus 
ban drag in their facilities.</li>

<p>Texas does not recognize non-binary gender.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>Medical transition for people under age 18 is subject to child abuse
investigations under executive orders, which are being challenged
with some success. Under attorney general opinion, medical transition
of youth is consider abuse.</li>
<li>Texas bans puberty blockers, HRT, and surgery for trans youth with few
exceptions. This bill's enforcement actions are targeted primarily towards
healthcare providers. While this <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/texas-families-and-medical-providers-sue-texas-to-block-dangerous-transgender-youth-medical-care-ban">was challenged in a
lawsuit</a>.
While a state district court granted an injunction against the ban,
on August 25, 2023, the state immediately appealed this decision to the
state supreme court, which <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/08/25/texas-transgender-kids-health-care-lawsuit/">blocks the
injunction</a>.
Thus, this law is in effect (at least on Sept. 26, 2023), which means
that trans youth are unable to access this medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans youth medical care is illegal in Texas.</li>
<li>An executive order instructs child services agencies to investigate
transgender children in many circumstances, placing custody at risk.</li>
<li>The executive order and legal opinion of the AG is being challenged
in court.</li>
<li>The anti-trans healthcare law penalizes healthcare providers, but not
parents (but it co-exists with the executive order and legal opinion of
the Attorney General).</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.</li>
<li>Note that the State's "Romeo and Juliet" law which provides exception
to some statutory rape laws where a minor is involved (if the partner is
within 3 years of age of the minor) does not apply to same-sex
partners. It's unknown how Texas will determine gender, although in
past cases regarding marriage, Texas jurisdictions have arrived at
different conclusions for trans people.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation
in schools.</p>

<p>The State has shown a willingness to investigate parents of transgender
kids, including subjecting them to different processes than are applied
for child abuse investigation (such as providing less of a paper trail).
People with transgender children should research the current status of
these laws in detail before traveling to Texas.</p>

<p>Cis women who do not look stereotypically female in a citizen's eyes
(regardless of actual appearance) have been <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/self-appointed-bathroom-cop-catches-dallas-woman-using-womens-restroom-8259104">harassed</a>
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/pdio76/dragged_out_of_bathroom/">kicked out</a>
of bathrooms by police or citizens.  In most cases, this is done with men
(police, citizens, etc) entering the women's bathroom, demanding ID, and
regardless of offered ID then kicking the woman out. In particular,
all women's bathroom users, trans or cis, who are sometimes read as men
(or do not present stereotypically femininely) should use caution.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Utah has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.</p>

<p>Utah does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).</p>

<p>Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from Utah's
and may lack some protections.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people in public
accommodations (it does include LGBT people in employment and
housing).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
many services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Utah</li>
<li>However, at least one city (St. George) is using an obscure city
ordinance to block permits for a drag event. This is being challenged
in court, with a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.139943/gov.uscourts.utd.139943.63.0.pdf">preliminary
injunction</a>
granted to allow drag to proceed in public spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are typically be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are typically be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized in limited ways.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Utah allows gender marker changes on IDs in some circumstances.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
providers). While the law itself does allow for the possibility of
hormone treatment of trans youth, in theory, the provisions are
extremely restrictive and place doctors at extreme financial risk,
resulting in this making it effectively a ban as any Utah provider would be
willing to take the risk of prescribing HRT or puberty blockers to
trans youth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.</li>
<li>Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
marriages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media

<p>Vermont recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary. Vermont has some of the
leading laws in the country and has demonstrated governmental will to
defend transgender youth.</p>

<p>Vermont is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Vermont will not cooperate with other states who seek information
about patients receiving care in Vermont for medical transition.</li>

against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Vermont will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many

states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Vermont via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<p>Washington is one of the safer states for trans people in the United
States. This does not mean to expect full equality in all instances, but
the letter of the law is generally non-discriminatory. Sex and gender
are treated the same under WA state law.</p>

<p>Washington explicitly protects trans medical care, including for
children. Care providers and homes for runaway you are not required to
notify parents in most cases that children receive gender-affirming
care. Washington does have a sanctuary law.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<li>Washington does not have religious freedom laws that allow denial of

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Incarceration of trans people is at the discretion of Washington's
Department of Corrections. According to policy, they must take into
consider safety on a case-by-case basis, and as such, there is no
guarantee a trans inmate will be housed according to their gender.</li>
<li>The state settled in October, 2023 with Disability Rights Washington.
The settlement <a href="https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/drw-reaches-agreement-with-doc-to-improve-care-for-transgender-people-with-disabilities/">requires better treatment of trans
prisoners</a>
by the Dept. of Corrections, including medical care, and access to
gender-affirming clothing. This impacts state facilities (but not
local or federal facilities).</li>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>By law, gender is based upon gender identity/expression, regardless
of assigned gender at birth.</li>
<li>Non-binary people are recognized and X is available as a gender
marker on state ID/forms.</li>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.</li>
<li>Some surgeries are available for trans youth.</li>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized in Wyoming.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Wyoming does not have a "sanctuary" law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Wyoming does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
transition-related medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Many areas of the state are extremely right-wing (such as Gillette) and
people in those locations strongly oppose trans people. Many Wyoming
residents tend to side uncritically with more extremist Republican
positions. In particular, some Gillette residents have shown willingness
to aggressively express hatred towards trans people. Jackson and Laramie
tend to be more progressive (by Wyoming standards).</p>

<p>While Laramie is considered progressive by Wyoming standards, it has
also attracted both in-state and out-of-state transphobic extremists
when University of Wyoming student groups show support for transgender
people. Transphobic speakers are invited by at least one student
organization to speak against transgender people on campus.</p>

<p>A Colorado athlete competing in an amateur (recreational) tennis competition
<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/08/04/citing-safety-concerns-transgender-tennis-player-withdraws-from-wyoming-governors-cup/">decided to not
compete</a>
during August, 2023, due to safety concerns. This was fed by her
forcible outing, media storm in Wyoming, and prominent Wyoming
politicians speaking out against her, causing the story to go
world-wide. Trans women in particular should be aware of negative
attention and potential violence should they participate in women's
activities in Wyoming.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Regulations around bathrooms will generally match those of public
accommodations in the city/state the airport is in, which doesn't
necessarily match the name the airport uses for itself.  Some US airports
may be in states you don't expect (Examples: Cincinnati's airport is in
Kentucky, while Kansas City's airport is on the Missouri side of the
border).</p>

<p>It is legal for all people to use non-gendered bathrooms.  Major
airports typically will have a non-gendered bathroom (perhaps labeled as
a family bathroom).</p>
</section><section id='file-65'><h1 id="toc-70">Flying with the TSA (Transportation Security Agency)</h1>

<p>When flying out of USA airports (including after connecting from
international flights), security screening is required.  This is done by
the TSA.</p>

<p>TSA recommends that tickets booked for travel out of USA airports be
booked with a gender marker that matches the gender on the person's ID
they are using for travel.  However, it is not technically required, and
not all airlines implement the "X" gender marker yet.</p>

<p>Note if you are traveling internationally, you may be required to travel
with a ticket booked with the same gender as the passport you will be
using.</p>

<p>TSA utilizes body scanning technology for travelers not selected for
pre-check (see below).  When using this technology, at most airports,
the screener will hit a pink or blue button based on the anatomy and/or
gender they think the passenger has/is.  This may or may not match
gender expression.  This adjusts the machine to expect certain anatomy.
If the pink button is pushed, a penis will likely alert the TSA (it
won't say what is wrong, but will place a colored box on a cartoon
figure of a passenger indicating what needs to be patted down by the
TSA).  If they hit a blue button, breasts will likely alert.</p>

<p>Pat downs of these sensitive areas may be aggressive and triggering. You
have the right to ask for a private space and the screener of the
desired gender, although official policies may not always be followed.</p>

<p>Behavior seen as aggressive towards the TSA may result in criminal or
civil action, and you may not be allowed through security.</p>

<h2>Gender Mismatch with ID</h2>

<p>In the USA, you should generally not have problems with a gender
expression that does not match your ID.  Note this does not apply at
international destinations.</p>

<h2>Pre-Check</h2>

<p>If you travel frequently and have the money to enroll, you can enroll in
the "Pre-Check" (or "Global Entry" which includes pre-check) program.
This increases your chance of being selected for pre-check screening. If
your boarding pass indicates "pre-check", you can use dedicated
pre-check lanes at most airports, and typically these will require a
metal detector but not body scanner, making travel possibly less
triggering. </p>

<h2>Note about International Travel</h2>

<p>This only applies to travel from USA-airports.  If you fly
internationally, airports in other countries will have different
procedures. Pre-check is a USA program, and does not apply outside the
USA.</p>
